# Dynamic Rainfall 2D Prototype

## Project Description
This is a **Dynamic Rainfall 2D Prototype** inspired by [Click The Red Button](https://clicktheredbutton.com/?site=722), built entirely from scratch by **Anusheel Soni**. The project features **interactive rainfall mechanics** that respond dynamically to the player's cursor movement, along with **thunder effects** for enhanced realism.

## Features
- **Cursor-based rainfall control**:
  - Rain **density and speed increase** as the cursor moves down the screen.
  - Background color gradually darkens with downward cursor movement.
  - **Thunder effect** activates when the cursor reaches the bottom.
- **Customizable particle system**:
  - Adjustable **rain emission rate, speed, gravity scale, and trail lifetime**.
  - Wind effect that **modifies rain velocity** based on cursor movement.
- **Trail effect** with customizable parameters.
- **Wind effect on the X-axis**:
  - Cursor movement affects rain velocity temporarily.
  - Wind decays over time for a natural effect.
- **Thunder system**:
  - Fully customizable **thunder interval time and duration**.

## Unity Version
This project was developed using **Unity 6 (6000.0.37f1)**.

## Project Structure
